### **Week 1: React Basics**
**Goal**: Understand core concepts of React and build simple components.

---

#### **Day 1 (Monday)**: React Setup and Fundamentals
- Install Node.js and set up a React app using `create-react-app`.
- Understand the basics:
  - JSX (JavaScript XML).
  - Components (functional and class-based).
  - Props (passing data between components).
- Create a simple "Hello, World!" app with functional components.

---

#### **Day 2 (Wednesday)**: State and Events
- Learn about React `useState` hook for managing state.
- Handle events (e.g., button clicks, form inputs).
- Build a simple counter app to practice state management and event handling.

---

#### **Day 3 (Friday)**: Component Lifecycle and Effects
- Understand React's component lifecycle (only for knowledge; hooks simplify this).
- Learn the `useEffect` hook for side effects (e.g., API calls, subscriptions).
- Build a weather app using `fetch` or `Axios` to get data from an API.

---

**Practice**:
- Revisit the concepts and build a small project, like a to-do list app, by the end of Week 1.

---

### **Week 2: Advanced React**
**Goal**: Master routing, forms, and advanced state management.

---

#### **Day 1 (Monday)**: React Router
- Install and use `react-router-dom`.
- Learn how to:
  - Set up routes for multiple pages (e.g., Home, About, Contact).
  - Use `<Link>` for navigation.
  - Use route parameters (`useParams`).

---

#### **Day 2 (Wednesday)**: Forms and Controlled Components
- Learn how to create forms in React.
- Understand controlled components (form inputs controlled by React state).
- Build a basic signup form with validation.

---

#### **Day 3 (Friday)**: Context API (Preparation for Redux)
- Learn the Context API for global state management.
- Build a small app (e.g., theme toggler) to understand how context works.

---

**Practice**:
- Build a multi-page website (e.g., blog) with routing and form handling.

---

### **Week 3: Redux Basics**
**Goal**: Learn Redux concepts and integrate it into a React app.

---

#### **Day 1 (Monday)**: Introduction to Redux
- Learn the core concepts:
  - Store, actions, reducers, and dispatch.
- Set up Redux in a simple JavaScript app (not React) to understand the flow.
- Install `redux` and `redux-toolkit`.

---

#### **Day 2 (Wednesday)**: Redux with React
- Learn how to:
  - Connect Redux to a React app using `react-redux`.
  - Use `useSelector` to access state and `useDispatch` to dispatch actions.
- Build a counter app using Redux and React.

---

#### **Day 3 (Friday)**: Redux Toolkit and Middleware
- Understand the Redux Toolkit for simplified Redux setup.
- Learn about middleware (e.g., Redux Thunk for async actions).
- Build a simple API-powered app (e.g., fetch a list of users from an API).

---

**Practice**:
- Enhance previous projects (e.g., to-do app) by integrating Redux for global state management.
