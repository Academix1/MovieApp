### **Frontend Concepts**
1. **React Router**
   - For navigating between pages like Home, Movie Details, Search Results, and Watchlist.
   - Dynamic routing to display specific movie details based on the movie ID.

2. **Axios (or Fetch API)**
   - For making API calls to TMDB.
   - Manage API keys securely (e.g., in environment variables).

3. **State Management with Redux**
   - Centralized state for user preferences (e.g., theme, language).
   - Global state for watchlist, favorite movies, and user-selected genres.

4. **React Context API (Optional)**
   - For lightweight state sharing, e.g., theme mode (light/dark).

5. **Material-UI Themes and Styling**
   - Customizing the UI using MUI's `ThemeProvider` for a consistent look and feel.

6. **Debouncing**
   - For optimizing search input to reduce API calls.

7. **Error Handling and Loading States**
   - Display fallback UI for API errors or empty states.
   - Skeleton loaders and spinners during data fetch.

8. **Responsive Design**
   - Make the app mobile-friendly using MUI's Grid system and breakpoints.

### **Backend/API Integration Concepts**
1. **Environment Variables**
   - Store TMDB API keys securely using `.env` files and integrate them into your app.

2. **Caching API Data**
   - Use Redux or React Query to cache movie data and reduce repeated API calls.

3. **Pagination**
   - Handle TMDB paginated API responses for lists of movies.

4. **Image Optimization**
   - Use responsive TMDB image URLs (`w500`, `original`, etc.) based on device size for faster loading.

### **Advanced Concepts**
1. **Authentication (Optional)**
   - Use OAuth or TMDB's user authentication API to allow users to log in and manage their watchlists.

2. **Code Splitting**
   - Use React's lazy loading to load components only when needed (e.g., movie details page).

3. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure the app is keyboard and screen reader-friendly.

4. **Testing**
   - Use tools like Jest or React Testing Library for component and API integration testing.

5. **Analytics (Optional)**
   - Track user activity like most-searched movies or watchlist interactions.

### **Features**
1. **Home Page**
   - Show trending movies, genres, and recommendations.

2. **Search Functionality**
   - Search movies by title or keyword with suggestions.

3. **Movie Details Page**
   - Display movie info, cast, reviews, trailers, and similar movies.

4. **Watchlist**
   - Allow users to add/remove movies from a watchlist stored in Redux or localStorage.

5. **Genre Filters**
   - Enable users to filter movies by genres using dropdowns or chips.

6. **Dark Mode Toggle**
   - Provide a button to toggle between light and dark themes.

### Technologies/Packages
1. **React Query (Optional)**
   - Simplifies API calls, caching, and state management.

2. **Framer Motion**
   - For animations like page transitions and hover effects.

3. **React Infinite Scroll**
   - Load more movies seamlessly as the user scrolls.

4. **LocalStorage/SessionStorage**
   - Persist watchlist and user preferences locally.

5. **Redux Toolkit**
   - Streamlined approach to Redux for managing complex state.
