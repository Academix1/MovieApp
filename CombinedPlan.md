# **4-Week Schedule: React and Movie App Development**

---

## **Week 1: React Concepts**
**Goal**: Learn React fundamentals and explore essential concepts for building the Movie App.

### **Day 1 (Monday): Props and `useState`**
- Understand Props and how to pass data between components.
- Learn `useState` for managing component state.
- Practice with a simple counter app to demonstrate state changes.

### **Day 2 (Wednesday): `useEffect` and Axios**
- Learn `useEffect` for handling side effects (e.g., fetching data, subscriptions).
- Explore Axios for API requests.
- Build a simple app that fetches data from an API and displays it.

### **Day 3 (Friday): Material UI and Dispatch**

- Learn the concept of dispatch to manage actions in state management libraries.
- Practice applying styles with Material UI in a sample component.

## **Week 2: Project - Movie App (Part 1)**
**Goal**: Set up the Movie App and implement the foundation with initial functionality.

### **Day 1 (Monday): Setting Up the React App**
- Create a new React app using `create-react-app`.
- Configure the project structure for scalability.

### **Day 2 (Wednesday): NavBar and Theme**
- Build a responsive NavBar using Material UI.
- Apply a theme using `theme.js` to provide consistent styling.

### **Day 3 (Friday): MovieCard and Home**
- Construct `MovieCard.js` to display individual movie details.
- Build `Home.js` to fetch and display popular movies using `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Integrate `Home.js` into `App.js`.

### **Day 4–6 (Saturday–Monday): Refine and Enhance**
- Test and debug the features implemented.
- Add basic error handling for API requests.

---

## **Week 3: Advanced React Concepts**
**Goal**: Explore routing and Redux to prepare for advanced functionality.

### **Day 1 (Monday): `react-router-dom`**
- Learn routing with `react-router-dom`.
- Implement navigation between multiple pages (e.g., Home, About, Movie Details).

### **Day 2 (Wednesday): Redux Core Concepts**
- Understand Redux fundamentals: Store, Actions, Reducers, Dispatch.
- Set up a Redux store and connect it to a sample React app.

### **Day 3 (Friday): `useSelector` and `useDispatch` with Redux**
- Learn how to:
  - Use `useSelector` to extract state from the Redux store.
  - Use `useDispatch` to dispatch actions to the Redux store.
- Build a small feature (e.g., fetching and displaying movie data) using Redux, `useSelector`, and `useDispatch`.

## **Week 4: Project - Movie App (Part 2)**
**Goal**: Complete the Movie App by adding advanced features and functionality.

### **Day 1 (Monday): Store and Reducers**
- Set up the Redux store and reducers for managing app state.
- Use Redux Thunk to handle asynchronous data fetching.

### **Day 2 (Wednesday): Genre Functionality**
- Fetch genres from the API and prepare `GenreSidebar`.
- Integrate `GenreSidebar` into `App.js`.

### **Day 3 (Friday): Movie Details and Routing**
- Create `MovieDetail.js` to display detailed information about a selected movie.
- Add routing for movie details in `App.js`.

### **Day 4 (Saturday): Search Functionality**
- Add a search bar component to allow searching for movies.
- Implement search functionality using Redux and the movie API.

### **Day 5 (Sunday): WatchList Functionality**
- Create a WatchList feature to save favorite movies.
- Add the functionality in `MovieCard.js` to toggle movies in the WatchList.

### **Day 6 (Monday): Final Testing and Debugging**
- Refine the app by testing all features.
- Debug and optimize API calls and performance.
